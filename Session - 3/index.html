    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript API </h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of tools and protocols that allow 
        developers to interact with web browsers and other services. They provide pre-defined functions and methods to
         perform common tasks, such as manipulating the DOM, handling events, making network requests, and working with multimedia.
    </p>
    <h2>4 - async/await </h2>
    <p>
        The async/await syntax in JavaScript is used to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and 
        manageable way. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
    </p>
    <h4>Key points:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>`async` before function means "this function has async operations"</li>
        <li>`await` means "wait for this to finish before moving on"</li>
        <li>`fetch()` makes the HTTP request</li>
        <li>`json()` converts the response to JavaScript object</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5 - Error Handling</h2>
    <p>
        Error handling in JavaScript APIs is crucial for ensuring that applications can gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as network failures, invalid responses, or other issues that may arise during API interactions. Proper error handling helps improve the user experience and maintain application stability.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>`try { }` - Try to run this code</li>
        <li>`catch (error) { }` - If anything fails, run this code instead</li>
        <li>`throw new Error()` - Manually create an error</li>
    </ul>
